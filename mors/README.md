#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/AxhajVtNkrs
#### Description:
It is a simple website for manual and document handling of machines and products.
You can create a list of machines store their documents in order.
You can also create qr codes to access them from anywhere.
Simple as that. Use it wisely.

#### FRAMEWORK:
Flask is used to create entire web-application. The database was sqlite3
and additional tools were python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

#### QR CODE:
I used pyqrcode library of python to create qrcodes automatically. The code will direct you to the "show.html" which is created via get request. Each page is going to have different link depending the id in the url.

#### DATABASE:
The database consists of two different table. One of them contains the existence of documents while the other store the machine list for your entire collection.

#### BOOTSTRAP:
For the HTML part I mainly used the bootstrap. It is then customized. To easily create my forms I used https://bootstrapformbuilder.com/ which completely compatible with the HTML and esy to use.

#### DESIGN:
All the icons and image used from bootstrap icon library and Canva. You can access and create your own logo for free from canva.com

#### REQUIREMENTS:
