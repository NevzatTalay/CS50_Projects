sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: sort1 is not the fastest so it can not be merge sort. Also, it takes longer in "reversed50000.txt". Bubble sort should take more time in reversed than the randomized data.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: It is the fastest. Also, when I increased the number of elements the sorting time didn't increase dramatically unlike the others. I bet it fits into nlog(n) distribution.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: It is the remainder. But the key is to have approximately same time on each of them.
